# Arcanum Coop Lite — investigation & design notes

Branch: `coop-lite-worldmap`
Date: 2026-10-19
Target: real-time co-op (up to 8 players) on arcanum-ce, campaign-compatible.
Required compatibility: **Arcanum: ReForged** ([kurkijar/Arcanum-ReForged](https://github.com/kurkijar/Arcanum-ReForged)).

**Status (coop-lite-worldmap-follow):** ENet transport + **priority (1)** —
host-only world map (`coop_lite_can_use_worldmap`), host teleport follow
broadcast (`PACKET_COOP_FOLLOW_HOST` / 129), host-authoritative game/anim time.
Single-player without `-coop` unchanged. Anim/combat receive apply still incomplete.

Runtime testing is currently impossible: game data is not on this box. A clean
**Steam** install archive is expected soon; ReForged will be installed from that
(see §4.0 Steam vs GOG).

## 1. What network / multiplayer code exists in arcanum-ce

### 1.1 Transport: ENet (Coop Lite)

`src/net_compat.h` now includes `src/net/tig_net.h`. Implementation:
`src/net/tig_net.c` on vendored **ENet 1.3.18** (MIT) under `third_party/enet/`.
Inactive unless `-coop` is passed (macros replaced by real functions that no-op
when coop is off). Historical stub behaviour for reference:

| Macro | Stub behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `tig_net_is_active()` | `0` |
| `tig_net_is_host()` | `0` |
| `tig_net_send_app_all` / `tig_net_send_app` / `tig_net_send_app_except` | no-op |
| `tig_net_start_server` / `tig_net_start_client` | no-op / `0` |
| `tig_net_on_message` / validation / network event | no-op |
| client info / xfer helpers | 0 / empty |

`first_party/tig/` has **no** net module (no sockets, no SDL_net, no enet).
The original Troika `tig_net` layer was never reimplemented. Upstream author
(Alex Batalov, medium post May 2025) stated remaining work was “mostly
networking and editor” and that he may remove multiplayer entirely.

### 1.2 Game-side MP logic: large but dead without transport

| File | Size | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/game/multiplayer.c` / `.h` | ~3043 / 71 lines | 8 player slots (`NUM_PLAYERS 8`), save/load, start/end, ping, flags, portrait/level-scheme helpers |
| `src/game/mp_utils.c` / `.h` | ~637 / 698 lines | ~50 `Packet*` structs + host-gated send wrappers |

Notable APIs:

- `multiplayer_init` / `exit` / `reset` / `save` / `mutliplayer_load`
- `multiplayer_start` / `multiplayer_end` (registers message callbacks into stubs)
- `multiplayer_find_slot_from_obj`, `multiplayer_player_find_first/next`
- `multiplayer_is_locked` / `lock` / `unlock`
- `multiplayer_map_open_by_name`, `multiplayer_timeevent_process`

**Receive path is incomplete:**

```c
void multiplayer_handle_message(void* msg)
{
    // TODO: Incomplete.
}

bool multiplayer_handle_network_event(int type, int client_id, void* data, int size)
{
    // TODO: Incomplete.
}
```

`multiplayer_validate_message` only checks `type` in `(0, 131)`.

Packet catalogue (partial): `PacketGamePlayerList` (type 2), `PacketGameTime`,
anim/combat packets 4–10, spell packets, inventory (`PacketUpdateInven` 94),
party/object destroy/summon, sound 106, services up through ~128, plus many
numeric types used in `mp_utils.c` (29, 70, 84, 92, 99, 100, 118, 121–123…).

All sends are gated on `tig_net_is_active()` / `tig_net_is_host()`, which are
always false → **SP path only**.

### 1.3 Player / PC representation

- `player_get_local_pc_obj()`, `player_is_local_pc_obj()`, `player_is_pc_obj()`
  (`src/game/player.c`)
- Local PC is a single `player_pc_obj` / `player_pc_oid`
- MP stores per-slot `ObjectID` in `stru_5E8AD0[8]` (see `multiplayer.c`)

### 1.4 World map / travel / time / dialog / save

| Area | Location | Notes for Coop Lite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| World map UI | `src/ui/wmap_ui.c` | `wmap_ui_open()`, `wmap_ui_teleport(loc)` → `teleport_do` with `player_get_local_pc_obj()`, `map_by_type(MAP_TYPE_START_MAP)` |
| Open callers | `intgame.c`, `dialog_ui.c` | Hotkey / dialog paths into classic wmap |
| Teleport | `src/game/teleport.c` | Canonical area change; also used by scripts, AI, map, magictech, jumppoints |
| Jump points | `src/game/jumppoint.c` | Local transitions |
| Time | `src/game/timeevent.c` | Includes `TIMEEVENT_TYPE_MULTIPLAYER`, `WORLDMAP`, `TELEPORTED`; `PacketGameTime` exists but never sent |
| Dialog | `src/game/dialog.c`, `src/ui/dialog_ui.c` | Merchant / NPC strings; no host/client role checks |
| Save | `gamelib_save` / `gamelib_load` | Host-owned world save is a future concern (priority 3) |

### 1.5 Verdict for priority (1)

**Implemented** on ENet: `coop_lite_can_use_worldmap()` gates classic
`wmap_ui_open_internal` (ReForged should call the same helper for
`ModernWorldMap`); host `teleport_process` for local PC broadcasts
`PACKET_COOP_FOLLOW_HOST`; clients apply via `teleport_do`. Clients no longer
advance game/anim time locally (`coop_lite_can_advance_game_time`). Next:
dialog restrictions (prio 2), saves (prio 3), anim receive handlers.

## 2. Outside projects (reuse check)

| Project | URL | License | Usable for Coop Lite? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Arcanum CE Restored** (techerrorcode) | https://github.com/techerrorcode/Arcanum-CE-Restored | Sustainable Use (CE) | Campaign co-op claimed (~85% private beta, Jul 2026 Reddit). Public repo is restoration/QoL; **working MP source not published**. Different MP design than stock Troika. Watch only; do not copy private beta. |
| **Arcanum: ReForged** | https://github.com/kurkijar/Arcanum-ReForged | Sustainable Use | **Required target environment.** Modified CE **binary** + HighRes config + DXIL shaders — not a data-only mod. Base CE commit `a7ff41b` (= this fork’s `main` tip). See §3–§4. |
| Classic Terra-Arcanum co-op / campaign MP modules | various forum threads | N/A | Old module hacks; not CE-compatible transport. Historical only. |
| Upstream alexbatalov/arcanum-ce | https://github.com/alexbatalov/arcanum-ce | Sustainable Use | Same stubs; networking unfinished by design. |

## 3. Arcanum: ReForged — what it changes

Release inspected: **v.1.0.0** /
`Arcanum-ReForged-V1.0.0.zip` (2026-09-29).

### 3.1 Package contents (no game data)

- `payload/arcanum-ce.exe` — **modified CE Windows executable** (not stock)
- `payload/HighRes/config.ini` — extended keys (`ModernWorldMap`, `BalanceFixes`,
  `GPUPresent`, `ModernDialog`, …)
- `payload/shaders/*.dxil` — GPU / native-UI shaders (Windows DXIL)
- `payload/HighRes/tools/arcanum-world-map-asset-export.exe` — HD map exporter
- Installer scripts: `Install-ShareableBuild.ps1`, `Build-LocalWorldMapHd.ps1`
- Docs / licenses under package root; notices copied to `legal/` at install

**Not shipped:** GOG `.dat` archives, saves, generated HD map tiles, FFplay,
UAP. UAP compatibility is explicitly untested by ReForged.

### 3.2 Installer behaviour (from `Install-ShareableBuild.ps1`)

Creates a **separate** destination folder; never mutates the source install
(GOG or Steam).

**Copied from game root (`GamePath`):**

- Files: `arcanum1.dat` … `arcanum4.dat`, `tig.dat`,
  `modules/Arcanum.dat`, `modules/Arcanum.PATCH0`, `modules/Vormantown.dat`
- Trees: `modules/Arcanum/movies/**`, `modules/Arcanum/sound/music/**`

**Copied from package payload into destination:**

- `arcanum-ce.exe` (from `payload/`)
- `shaders/*.dxil` → `shaders/`
- Fresh `HighRes/config.ini` (Width/Height/Windowed substituted) unless `-Update`
- Optional `ffplay.exe` beside the exe
- License files → `legal/`

Optional `-GenerateHdMap` builds 64 tiles into `HighRes/world-map/tiles/` and
sets `HDWorldMap=1` (Windows-only toolchain).

### 3.3 Conflict notes for Coop Lite

1. **Binary fork, not overlay.** ReForged players run *their* `arcanum-ce.exe`.
   Coop patches in this GitHub fork do **not** appear until merged into the
   ReForged binary lineage (or ReForged rebases onto this fork).
2. **Same CE base tip:** ReForged imported CE at `a7ff41b`, which matches
   `semenbuzanen-eng/arcanum-ce` `main` at investigation time — good merge base.
3. **`ModernWorldMap=1`:** gating only classic `wmap_ui_open()` is **insufficient**
   under ReForged. Authority must live in shared CE paths (`teleport_do`, map
   open, timeadvance), which both UIs should still call.
4. **`HighRes/config.ini`:** stock CE (`highres_config.c`) only understands
   Width/Height/Windowed/ShowFPS/Scroll*/Logos/Intro. Unknown ReForged keys are
   ignored by stock CE (safe). Coop should add keys carefully (e.g.
   `CoopLite=0`) without breaking ReForged’s parser when merged.
5. **Shaders are DXIL / Windows.** Linux CE build here does not consume them.
   ReForged on Linux (if ever) needs Wine for the ReForged exe, or a native
   ReForged port.
6. **No `.dat` / script patches in the zip.** Loading Steam/GOG data is unchanged;
   coop must not require exclusive module layouts that break that copy set.
7. **BalanceFixes** are engine-side rule tweaks in the ReForged binary — not
   present in stock CE. Coop must not assume stock combat numbers when testing
   under ReForged.

---

## 4. Exact ReForged install procedure (for when game data arrives)

Official package:
https://github.com/kurkijar/Arcanum-ReForged/releases/download/v.1.0.0/Arcanum-ReForged-V1.0.0.zip

Do **not** use the GitHub “Source code” archives (README + LICENSE only).

### 4.0 Steam vs GOG (user has Steam)

ReForged’s published docs and installer examples assume an **English GOG**
folder (`-GamePath 'C:\GOG Games\Arcanum'`). The user’s copy is **Steam**.
Practical differences for CE / ReForged:

| Topic | Steam | GOG | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core data layout | Same: `arcanum1–4.dat`, `tig.dat`, `modules/`, movies/music under `modules/Arcanum/` | Same | CE and the ReForged **file-copy** recipe work from either if those files exist |
| Game version | Typically 1.0.7.4 English on Steam | Same English build commonly used for CE/UAP | Prefer English; UAP (if ever used) is English-only |
| Extra launcher / DRM | Steam client / depot layout; may include legacy CD-launcher bits | DRM-free offline folder; `innoextract` friendly | For Coop Lite we only need the **data tree**, not Steamworks |
| Path on disk | e.g. `…/Steam/steamapps/common/Arcanum` (verify locally) | e.g. `C:\GOG Games\Arcanum` | Point `-GamePath` / `$GAME` at the folder that contains the `.dat` files |
| ReForged official support | **Not documented** by ReForged | Documented | Use the same required-file checklist; if the official `.ps1` rejects the path, use the Linux/manual copy recipe (§4.3) |
| Filename case | Windows installs are case-insensitive; archives may ship `Arcanum4.dat` vs `arcanum4.dat` | Same caveat | On Linux, normalize/copy with the names CE expects (`arcanum1.dat` … `arcanum4.dat`, `tig.dat`) |
| Optional folders | May or may not include loose `data/` | Same | ReForged installer does **not** require top-level `data/`; CE can use DAT repositories alone |
| UAP | Same English constraint | Same | ReForged does **not** ship or test UAP; leave UAP off for first Coop Lite bring-up |

**Checklist before install:** confirm the Steam folder (or extracted archive) contains
every path in §4.1. If movies/music live only inside DATs on some Steam layouts,
copy what exists and note missing folders — CE README’s “minimum installation”
still wants loose `modules/Arcanum/movies` and `…/sound/music` for BIK/MP3; if
absent, extract from the user’s archive or from `modules/Arcanum.dat` later.
Do **not** run Steam while testing a copied tree; keep the ReForged destination
outside `steamapps/common` so Steam cannot overwrite it.

### 4.1 Prerequisites

- English Arcanum install (**Steam** for this user; GOG also fine).
- Required under the game root (`$GAME` / `-GamePath`):
  - `arcanum1.dat` … `arcanum4.dat`, `tig.dat`
  - `modules/Arcanum.dat`, `modules/Arcanum.PATCH0`, `modules/Vormantown.dat`
  - `modules/Arcanum/movies/`, `modules/Arcanum/sound/music/`
- Destination folder must be **empty** and **separate** from the Steam/GOG
  source and from the unpacked ReForged zip (never install into
  `steamapps/common/Arcanum`).
- Optional: standalone `ffplay.exe` for BIK movies.
- Optional HD map: Windows + PowerShell; Vulkan Real-ESRGAN optional.

### 4.2 Windows (official)

```powershell
# 1. Extract Arcanum-ReForged-V1.0.0.zip to e.g. C:\Temp\ReForgedPkg
# 2. From that folder:
.\Install-ShareableBuild.ps1 `
  -GamePath 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arcanum' `  # adjust to actual Steam path
  -DestinationPath 'C:\Games\Arcanum-ReForged' `
  -Width 1920 -Height 1080 -Windowed 0

# Optional movies:
#   -MoviePlayerPath 'C:\Tools\ffplay.exe'
# Optional HD world map (Windows-only scripts/exes):
#   -GenerateHdMap -MapBackend Vulkan -UpscalerPath '...\realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan.exe'

# 3. Launch:
#   C:\Games\Arcanum-ReForged\arcanum-ce.exe
```

`-Update` refreshes package files but **preserves** existing
`HighRes/config.ini`.

### 4.3 Linux / this box (file-copy equivalent; no Wine required for layout)

ReForged’s playable bits are mostly **file copies**. The official installer is
PowerShell + a **Windows PE** `arcanum-ce.exe`. On Linux we can stage the same
tree for data/config validation; **running** the ReForged UI requires Wine
(or waiting for a native ReForged build). Stock Linux `arcanum-ce` from this
repo can run against the **copied Steam/GOG data** (classic UI; ignores modern
config keys / DXIL shaders).

Suggested layout once the Steam (or GOG) archive is unpacked to `$GAME`:

```bash
PKG=/path/to/unpacked/Arcanum-ReForged-V1.0.0   # zip contents
GAME=/path/to/clean/steam/Arcanum               # folder that contains *.dat
DST=/path/to/Arcanum-ReForged                    # empty directory (not under steamapps)

mkdir -p "$DST/modules/Arcanum" "$DST/shaders" "$DST/HighRes" "$DST/legal"

# --- game data (same set as Install-ShareableBuild.ps1) ---
# Normalize case if the archive used Arcanum4.dat etc.
for f in arcanum1.dat arcanum2.dat arcanum3.dat arcanum4.dat tig.dat; do
  src=$(find "$GAME" -maxdepth 1 -iname "$f" | head -1)
  test -n "$src" || { echo "MISSING $f"; exit 1; }
  cp -a "$src" "$DST/$f"
done
cp -a "$GAME/modules/Arcanum.dat" "$GAME/modules/Arcanum.PATCH0" \
      "$GAME/modules/Vormantown.dat" "$DST/modules/"
cp -a "$GAME/modules/Arcanum/movies" "$DST/modules/Arcanum/"
cp -a "$GAME/modules/Arcanum/sound" "$DST/modules/Arcanum/"   # includes music/

# --- ReForged payload ---
cp -a "$PKG/payload/arcanum-ce.exe" "$DST/arcanum-ce.exe"
cp -a "$PKG/payload/shaders/"*.dxil "$DST/shaders/"
cp -a "$PKG/payload/HighRes/config.ini" "$DST/HighRes/config.ini"
# Edit Width/Height/Windowed in HighRes/config.ini as needed.

# --- legal notices ---
mkdir -p "$DST/legal/third_party"
cp -a "$PKG/LICENSE.md" "$PKG/MODIFICATIONS.md" "$PKG/THIRD_PARTY.md" "$DST/legal/"
cp -a "$PKG/third_party/." "$DST/legal/third_party/"

# Optional: ffplay for movies (Wine will need a Windows ffplay.exe;
# native Linux ffplay may work with stock Linux CE but not with Wine PE).
# cp "$(command -v ffplay)" "$DST/ffplay.exe"   # only if using Windows binary

# HD map generation: skip on Linux for now (exporter is a Windows .exe).
# Leave HDWorldMap=1; ReForged falls back to original map if tiles missing.
```

**Verify required files exist:**

```bash
for f in arcanum1.dat arcanum2.dat arcanum3.dat arcanum4.dat tig.dat \
         modules/Arcanum.dat modules/Arcanum.PATCH0 modules/Vormantown.dat \
         arcanum-ce.exe HighRes/config.ini; do
  test -e "$DST/$f" || echo "MISSING $f"
done
test -d "$DST/modules/Arcanum/movies" || echo "MISSING movies"
test -d "$DST/modules/Arcanum/sound/music" || echo "MISSING music"
```

**Run options after install:**

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Classic CE on Linux (this fork’s binary) | `cd "$DST" && /path/to/out/build/linux-x64-release/arcanum-ce -window` |
| Full ReForged UI | Wine: `cd "$DST" && wine arcanum-ce.exe` (needs Wine + Windows deps; untested here) |

PowerShell under `pwsh` on Linux can also run `Install-ShareableBuild.ps1`
**if** available, but the script still installs a Windows exe; HD-map generation
still needs Windows tools. Prefer the explicit `cp` recipe above for
reproducibility on this box.

### 4.4 Dest folder shape (after install)

```
Arcanum-ReForged/
  arcanum-ce.exe          # ReForged Windows binary
  arcanum1.dat … arcanum4.dat
  tig.dat
  HighRes/config.ini
  shaders/*.dxil
  modules/
    Arcanum.dat
    Arcanum.PATCH0
    Vormantown.dat
    Arcanum/movies/…
    Arcanum/sound/music/…
  legal/…
  [optional] ffplay.exe
  [optional] HighRes/world-map/tiles/world-map-001.png … 064.png
```

## 5. Priority (1) design — when transport exists

Do **not** invent sockets here. Intended minimal CE-side hooks (ReForged-safe):

1. **`coop_lite` module** (new): role flag `host | client | off`, gated by
   setting / `HighRes` key `CoopLite=0|1` and runtime host election once net
   works. Default **off** so stock SP and ReForged SP are unchanged.
2. **World map open gate:** early return in `wmap_ui_open()` for non-host when
   coop active. Also document that ReForged `ModernWorldMap` must call the same
   gate (or share `coop_lite_can_open_world_map()`).
3. **Travel authority:** after successful host `wmap_ui_teleport` / area
   `teleport_do` that changes map for the host PC, call
   `coop_lite_broadcast_follow_host(dest_map, dest_loc)` which:
   - uses `tig_net_send_app_all` **when real**, or
   - a clearly named packet (reuse unused type ≥ 129 only after validating the
     1..130 range in `multiplayer_validate_message`) carrying map id + loc;
   - clients apply via `teleport_do` on **their** local player object (not as
     story PC for scripts).
4. **Interior / jumppoint transitions** initiated by host: same follow broadcast.
5. Until `tig_net` is real: keep send helpers as no-ops; unit-test gates in SP
   with a forced `coop_lite` role override for UI blocking only.

### Missing before priority (1) is end-to-end

- Real `tig_net` (or replacement: e.g. SDL_net / ENet) in `first_party/tig`
- Implement `multiplayer_handle_message` dispatch
- Host election / session join
- Mapping remote players to objects (stock slot table is a starting point)

### Priorities (2) and (3) — notes only

**Dialog (2):** Restrict non-host dialog starts with story/quest NPCs; allow
merchants / non-quest chatter. Likely hooks in `dialog_ui` / script dialog
entry; need quest-giver detection (quest flags / script meta). Info-only mode
for blocked NPCs. ReForged `ModernDialog=1` must call the same gate.

**Saves (3):** Host owns `gamelib_save` world state; each client keeps character
blob (stats/inventory/equipment/level). Stock MP save paths in `multiplayer.c`
may partially apply once net works; design per-client char files + host world
slot. Do not diverge save version from ReForged/CE without a migration note.

---

## 6. Build status (this machine)

- Configured: `cmake --preset linux-x64-release`
- Built: `cmake --build --preset linux-x64-release` → **success**
- Artifact: `out/build/linux-x64-release/arcanum-ce` (~7 MB)
- Deps installed via apt: cmake, ninja, X11/ALSA/Pulse, `libxss-dev`,
  `libxtst-dev`, etc.
- **No game data** → no runtime / ReForged install verification yet.

---

## 7. Recommended next steps

1. When Steam archive arrives: unpack → verify §4.1 files (§4.0) → apply §4.3
   copy recipe → confirm stock Linux CE boots; optionally try Wine for
   ReForged exe.
2. Decide transport: revive Troika-shaped `tig_net` vs new thin UDP/TCP layer
   that still feeds `multiplayer_handle_message`.
3. Implement §5 gates behind `CoopLite`, with forced-role SP tests for wmap
   block; share API with ReForged maintainers for `ModernWorldMap`.
4. Priority (2) dialog policy, then (3) split saves.
5. Track CE Restored public MP release for ideas — do not depend on private
   beta binaries.

---

## 8. What landed in coop-lite-net

- ENet transport: `src/net/tig_net.{c,h}`, vendored `third_party/enet/` (MIT)
- `src/net_compat.h` → real API (SP unchanged without `-coop`)
- Dispatch + join/leave in `multiplayer.c`; `multiplayer_ping` pumps ENet
- CLI: `-coop`, `-host [port]`, `-join host[:port]`
- Headless test: `tig_net_loopback_test` (CTest)
- Docs: host/join, Coop Anything strategy map (§9–§10)

---

## 9. How to host / join (Coop Lite net)

Requires a build with this branch. **Game data still required to play**; the
loopback test does not need data.

```bash
# Terminal A — host (default port 7777)
./arcanum-ce -window -coop -host 7777

# Terminal B — client
./arcanum-ce -window -coop -join 192.168.1.10:7777
```

Notes:

- Without `-coop`, `tig_net_is_active()` stays false — identical to pre-net SP.
- `-host` / `-join` imply configuring the session; both require `-coop`.
- Max players: 8 (slot 0 = host). File xfer (`tig_net_xfer_*`) is still a no-op
  (map streaming for late join is a known gap).
- Direct IP only for now (LAN / VPN / Tailscale). Steam relay is a future option
  per Coop Anything networking playbook — not implemented here.
- Headless proof: `tig_net_loopback_test` or `ctest -R tig_net_loopback`.

---

## 10. Coop Anything strategy map

**What it is:** [cranebeaker/coop-anything](https://github.com/cranebeaker/coop-anything)
— MIT-licensed MCP server + playbook that guides agents to revive or build
co-op for single-player games. It is **not** a drop-in netcode library; it is
process/docs (see `playbook/networking.md`, `playbook/how-coop-mods-work.md`).
License: MIT (Copyright 2026 cranebeaker and contributors).

Strategies taken from that playbook (not invented) and how Coop Lite applies them:

| Coop Anything strategy | Source | Applied in Coop Lite? | How / why not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Host-authoritative state sync** (default for SP retrofits) | networking.md §0–1.1 | **Yes (design)** | Host is slot 0; clients send app packets to host; host broadcasts. Matches Troika `tig_net_is_host()` gating already in CE. |
| **Client-owned avatar / camera** (client-auth with host arbitration for shared state) | networking.md §1.1, §1.3 | **Partial** | Spec: each player keeps own character (stats/inventory). Story/quests/world = host. Transport ready; ownership rules not fully coded yet. |
| **ENet as C transport** | networking.md §0, §2 | **Yes** | Vendored ENet 1.3.18, reliable UDP, 2 channels (app + session control). |
| **Reliable for events, not for continuous motion** | networking.md §1.2 | **Partial** | All app sends currently reliable (CE packet model). Future: unreliable channel for high-rate pose if needed. |
| **Entity ownership (NPC AI on host)** | how-coop-mods-work.md §1.2 | **Planned** | Host runs world AI; remote players are puppets. Stock MP slots support this; puppet spawn not done. |
| **Quest/story flags: host owns, mirror writes** | networking.md §1.3; methods.md host-authority table | **Planned (prio 2)** | Aligns with user dialog restrictions. |
| **Time / weather / RNG: host broadcasts** | networking.md §1.3 | **Yes (time)** | Clients skip local clock advance; host sends type 3 ~1 Hz; clients `timeevent_sync`. Weather/RNG not specially handled. |
| **Dialog/cutscenes: one driver, others watch** | networking.md §1.3; how-coop-mods-work.md §1.5 | **Planned (prio 2)** | User: non-hosts blocked from story/quest NPCs. |
| **Follow-the-leader on map change** | networking.md §1.4 | **Yes** | Host-only wmap; `coop_lite_notify_host_teleported` → packet 129 → client `teleport_do`. |
| **Host save is canonical; clients keep char only** | networking.md §1.4; how-coop-mods-work.md §1.4 | **Planned (prio 3)** | Matches user save split. |
| **Late join = full snapshot then deltas** | networking.md §1.4; how-coop-mods-work.md §1.8 | **Not yet** | Needs xfer + world dump; `tig_net_xfer_*` still no-op. Documented gap. |
| **Delta / snapshot compression, priority accumulator** | networking.md §1.2 | **Not yet** | Premature until entity sync volume exists; CE uses discrete event packets today. |
| **Interest management** | networking.md §1.2; how-coop-mods-work.md §1.7 | **Not yet** | Playbook: start without it for small co-op; add when profiling demands. Area-follow rule reduces need. |
| **Desync detection via state hash / soak** | networking.md §5; how-coop-mods-work.md §1.6; lessons.md | **Not yet** | Add after gameplay sync; loopback test covers transport only. |
| **Deterministic lockstep** | networking.md §1.1 | **No** | Playbook: unrealistic for non-deterministic SP engines. CE is not bit-exact. |
| **Steam Spacewar relay** | networking-steam-spacewar.md | **Not yet** | Keep direct IP; add relay later for Steam friends without port forward. |
| **Path 1: revive existing co-op** | README | **Yes (process)** | We revive CE's stubbed Troika MP layer rather than inventing parallel netcode. |
| **Automated in-game bot QA** | automated-qa.md; lessons.md | **Partial** | Headless transport test now; in-game bots need Steam data + later work. |

## 11. Known gaps / risks (net)

- **Unhandled packet types:** anim/combat/magictech receive apply incomplete — clients may not see remote animations until handlers are ported.
- **File xfer:** map/module streaming for join-in-progress not implemented.
- **No Steam relay / NAT traversal** beyond what the user's VPN provides.
- **ReForged:** still a separate Windows binary; must merge or rebase to pick up `tig_net`. Gate world-map at `teleport_do` so `ModernWorldMap` stays compatible.
- **Endianness / struct layout:** packets are raw structs (LAN same-arch assumption).
- **Pause / script spam:** no host-only script suppression yet (Coop Anything FNV lesson).

## 12. Priority 1 implementation (`coop-lite-worldmap-follow`)

| API / hook | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `coop_lite_can_use_worldmap()` | Shared CE check: allow wmap iff SP or coop host. Call from ReForged modern wmap too. |
| `coop_lite_can_advance_game_time()` | Host/SP only advance clocks |
| `coop_lite_notify_host_teleported(map, loc)` | Host broadcast after local-PC `teleport_process` |
| `PACKET_COOP_FOLLOW_HOST` (129) | Reliable follow payload `{type,map,loc}` |
| `wmap_ui_open_internal` | Early reject + feedback mes 605 for non-hosts |
| `teleport_process` | Notifies follow when `TELEPORT_IS_LOCAL_PC` |
| `timeevent_ping` | Clients skip `datetime_add_milliseconds` for game/anim |

Tests: `coop_lite_policy_test` (SP gates, host/client gates, follow round-trip);
existing `tig_net_loopback_test`.

Gaps: ReForged binary must link/call the helper; no in-game QA without Steam data;
follow uses exact host loc (no per-slot offset); jumppoint/script teleports of
non-PC objects do not trigger follow (only local PC teleports).
